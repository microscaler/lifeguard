# Introduction

**Lifeguard** is a coroutine-friendly, high-performance PostgreSQL connection pool designed for Rust applications using [SeaORM](https://www.sea-ql.org/SeaORM/) and the [`may`](https://github.com/Xudong-Huang/may) coroutine runtime.

It is optimized for performance, observability, and composability within modern Rust microservices.
