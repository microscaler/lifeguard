  = note: This error indicates that an index is trying to reference a column that doesn't exist on the struct.
  = note: Only columns that exist on this struct can be indexed. For child entities that reference parent tables via foreign keys, index only the child's own columns, not the parent's columns.
  = note: Fields marked with #[skip] or #[ignore] are not database columns and cannot be indexed.
