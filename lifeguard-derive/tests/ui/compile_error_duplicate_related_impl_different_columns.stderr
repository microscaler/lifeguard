error: Multiple relations target the same entity `PostEntity` with different column configurations.

       First relation `CreatedPosts` uses:
       - from: Column::Id
       - to: PostColumn::CreatorId

       Second relation `EditedPosts` uses:
       - from: Column::Id
       - to: PostColumn::EditorId

       Rust doesn't allow multiple `impl Related<PostEntity> for Entity` implementations.
       The macro would silently discard the second configuration, leading to incorrect queries.

       Solution: Use different target entities, or ensure all relations to the same entity use identical column configurations.
